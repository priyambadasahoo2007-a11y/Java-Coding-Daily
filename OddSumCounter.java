/*
Write a Java program that uses a do-while loop to do the following:

Initialize a variable sum to 0.
Initialize a variable number to 1.
In each iteration, add number to sum.
Increment number by 2 in each iteration (i.e., 1, 3, 5, ...).
print number and sum:
Sum is: [The sum value]
Num is: [The number value]
Continue the loop as long as number is less than or equal to 50.
Print the final value of sum after the loop finishes: Final Sum: [The final sum value
