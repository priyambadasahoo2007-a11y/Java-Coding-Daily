/*
You're creating a simple game score tracker. The program starts with certain values and you need to update them using increment and decrement operators.

You start with these initial values:
lives = 3
score = 100
level = 1
coins = 5
Perform these operations in order:
Player lost 2 lives (use decrement twice)
Player collected 3 coins (use increment three times)
Player gained 1 life (use increment once)
Player advanced to next level (use increment once)
Player lost 4 coins (use decrement four times)
The program will show the final values after your operations.
